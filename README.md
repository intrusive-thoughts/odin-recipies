### TheOdinProject demonstration and practice of HTML knowledge.

1. Create an `index.html` file. ✔️
2. Make HTML boilerplate and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body. ✔️
3. Create a new directory within the `odin-recipes` directory and name it `recipes`. ✔️
4. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. ✔️
5. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content in the recipe file.
6. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. ✔️
7. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier. ✔️
8. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe. ✔️
9. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe. ✔️
10. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish. ✔️
11. Add two more recipes with identical page structures. ✔️
12. Link to the new recipes on the index page. Consider putting the links in an unordered list. ✔️
