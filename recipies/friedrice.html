    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fried Rice is a flavorful dish made with cooked rice that's stir-fried in a wok or frying pan and is mixed with ingredients like vegetables, eggs, and sometimes meat or seafood. It often includes onions, peas, carrots, and seasonings such as soy sauce, with garlic and green onions to enhance flavor. Fried Rice is a great way to use leftover rice, making it a staple in many households.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Rice: 2 cups (preferably cold, day-old rice works best as it's less sticky)</li> 
        <li>Eggs: 2, beaten</li> 
        <li>Vegetables: 1 cup, can include peas, diced carrots, and bell peppers</li> 
        <li>Onion: 1 small, finely chopped</li> 
        <li>Green Onions: 2-3, chopped, for garnish</li> 
        <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, minced</li> 
        <li>Soy Sauce: 2-3 tablespoons, adjust to taste</li> 
        <li>Sesame Oil: 1 teaspoon</li> 
        <li>Vegetable Oil: 2 tablespoons, for frying</li> 
        <li>Optional: Cooked chicken, shrimp, or pork, about 1 cup</li> 
        <li>Salt and Pepper: To taste</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep Ingredients</li>
        <p>Make sure all ingredients are prepped before you start cooking. Fried rice comes together quickly once you begin.</p>
        <li>Scramble the Eggs</li>
        <p>Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</p>
        <li>Sauté Vegetables</li>
        <p>In the same pan, add a bit more oil and sauté the onions, garlic, and any other harder vegetables like carrots until they start to soften. If using softer vegetables like peas or corn, add them later to avoid overcooking.</p>
        <li>Add Rice and Seasonings</li>
        <p>Add the cold rice, breaking up any clumps. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the rice is heated through. Pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil, stirring to combine everything evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <li>Combine Everything</li>
        <p>Add the scrambled eggs back into the pan, along with any cooked meat or additional ingredients you're using. Mix well to distribute the eggs and other components throughout the rice.</p>
        <li>Garnish and Serve</li>
        <p>Finish by stirring in the green onions. Serve hot, garnished with extra green onions or sesame seeds if desired.</p>
    </ol>
