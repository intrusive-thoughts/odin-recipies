    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sushi Rice or Short-Grain Rice: 2 cups, cooked and slightly cooled</li>   
        <li>Fillings: Options include cooked salmon, tuna mixed with mayonnaise, pickled plum, or any preferred filling</li>   
        <li>Nori: Sheets cut into strips or bands, for wrapping</li>   
        <li>Salt: To taste</li>   
        <li>Water: For wetting hands to prevent sticking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Rice</li>
        <p>Cook the rice according to package instructions. Let it cool slightly until it's comfortable to handle but still warm.</p>
        <li>Prepare Fillings</li>
        <p>While the rice is cooling, prepare your chosen fillings, cutting them into small pieces if necessary.</p>
        <li>Shape Onigiri</li>
        <p>Wet your hands with water and sprinkle them with a bit of salt. Take a handful of rice and form a hollow center for the filling. Place your filling in the center, then add a bit more rice on top. Gently press and shape the rice into a triangle, ball, or cylinder.</p>
        <li>Wrap with Nori</li>
        <p>Wrap the shaped onigiri with a strip of nori for easier handling and flavor. The nori can be added just before eating to keep it crisp.</p>
        <li>Serve</li>
        <p>Onigiri can be enjoyed immediately or packed as a snack or meal for later. It's a versatile and satisfying option that showcases the simple beauty of Japanese cuisine.</p>
