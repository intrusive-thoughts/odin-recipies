    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pasta Cacio e Uova, a traditional Neapolitan dish, features a simple yet delicious combination of pasta, eggs, and cheese. The pasta is typically cooked al dente and then tossed with beaten eggs, grated cheese (such as Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), and a bit of black pepper. The heat from the pasta and the mixing action of tossing create a creamy sauce from the eggs and cheese. This dish is often enjoyed as a comforting and satisfying meal, showcasing the rich flavors of the ingredients.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: 400 grams (about 14 ounces) of spaghetti or your preferred pasta type</li>   
        <li>Eggs: 4 large, preferably at room temperature</li>   
        <li>Cheese: 1 cup of grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving</li>   
        <li>Black Pepper: Freshly ground, to taste</li>   
        <li>Salt: To taste, for pasta water and adjustment of final flavors</li>   
        <li>Optional Additions: Some variations may include a small amount of garlic, parsley, or chili flakes for added flavor, but these are not traditional.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta</li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Remember that the pasta will continue to cook slightly when mixed with the eggs and cheese, so aim for a firm bite.</p>
        <li>Prepare the Egg and Cheese Mixture</li>
        <p>While the pasta is cooking, in a large bowl, beat the eggs. Add the grated cheese (Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano) and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Mix well to combine. You can adjust the pepper according to your taste preferences.</p>
        <li>Reserve Pasta Water</li>
        <p>Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water. This water will help to create a silky sauce that clings to the pasta.</p>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Egg Mixture</li>
        <p>Drain the pasta and quickly add it to the bowl with the egg and cheese mixture. Toss vigorously to combine. The heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs, forming a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick or the pasta too dry, add a little reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until you achieve the desired consistency. The sauce should be creamy and coat the pasta evenly.</p>
        <li>Adjust Seasonings</li>
        <p>Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional cheese, black pepper, or a pinch of salt if needed. Remember, the cheese is salty, so be cautious with additional salt.</p>
        <li>Serve Immediately</li>
        <p>Serve the pasta immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper on top. The dish is best enjoyed hot, straight from the pan to the plate.</p>
